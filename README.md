# OurTimeApp
A school project created by Lars, Luka, Nathalie and Philip.

We used Trello to plan and distribute the work. Here we could easely follow the work progress.-> <a href="https://trello.com/b/HIuBB0vd/the-poop-scientists">Trello</a>
 
In this SPA (Single Page Application) the user can set a timer and add the options "Interval" and "Sleep 5 min".

It has six views:

-Loading screen

-Digital timer

-Set Timer

-Analog timer

-Alarm-view

-Break-view


In the hamburger meny the user can choose to navigate between the three main views (Digital timer, Set timer and Analog timer).
When the timer has been set and the time has been counted down, either the Alarm-view or the Break-view will pop up (depending on which option the user chose, Interval/Sleep 5 min)

Enjoy!
